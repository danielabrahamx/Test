Details

Insuracle is developing a decentralized parametric insurance platform that automates policy issuance, verification, and claims processing using smart contracts and oracle networks. By leveraging verifiable, objective data inputs (such as flood water levels or stolen credentials on the dark web), Insuracle eliminates subjective claim assessments and intermediaries, resulting in faster payouts, lower costs, and expanded coverage to traditionally underserved areas.  

Our protocol will allow anyone to create, purchase, or invest in parametric insurance policies through a simple interface, while the underlying smart contracts handle the entire lifecycle automatically. When predefined conditions are met (verified through oracles), payouts are triggered immediately without requiring claims filing or manual review. 

Insuracle will initially focus on two high-demand verticals: natural disaster coverage (floods, drought) and cyber risk protection, both areas where traditional insurance falls short in accessibility and response time.
What innovation or value will your project bring to Arbitrum? What previously unaddressed problems is it solving? Is the project introducing genuinely new mechanisms.

Insuracle brings significant innovation to Arbitrum by establishing an entirely new financial primitive: automated parametric insurance. This represents one of the first comprehensive insurance protocols on Arbitrum, addressing a critical gap in the ecosystem's financial infrastructure.

Our key innovations include:

Risk-Transfer Primitives: We're creating the first dedicated insurance building blocks for Arbitrum, allowing other protocols to integrate risk protection directly. This enables new composable DeFi applications previously impossible without insurance components.

Real-World Data Infrastructure: Insuracle is developing specialized oracle adaptors for insurance-specific data sources (flood sensors, weather stations, cyber breach monitoring), expanding Arbitrum's connection to real-world data beyond price feeds.

Capital Efficiency Mechanisms: Our risk tranching approach introduces a novel way to segment and price risk on-chain, allowing capital providers to precisely target specific risk exposures with optimized returns—a mechanism not currently available on Arbitrum.

Insuracle solves several previously unaddressed problems:

Financial Protection Gap: No current Arbitrum protocol offers parametric protection for real-world risks affecting users' livelihoods and businesses.

Risk Hedging for DeFi Users: Arbitrum users currently have limited options to hedge against systematic risks affecting their portfolios and activities.

Accessible Insurance Alternatives: Traditional insurance remains inaccessible to many Arbitrum users, particularly those in emerging markets where centralized infrastructure is lacking.

Our genuinely new mechanisms include:

Multi-Condition Trigger Framework: Unlike simple binary oracle conditions, our protocol enables complex, multi-variable parametric triggers with graduated payout structures.

Geographic Risk Mapping: We're implementing on-chain geographic risk assessment for location-based parametric triggers, a novel capability for blockchain applications.

Automated Regulatory Compliance: Our protocol incorporates programmable compliance parameters to address insurance regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.

These innovations position Insuracle to become a foundational component of Arbitrum's financial ecosystem while extending the network's utility into previously untapped insurance markets.

What is the current stage of your project.

Raising funds to build MVP

Do you have a target audience? If so, which one.

Insuracle is currently at the conceptual development stage with preliminary market research and technical architecture design completed. We've developed:

High-level smart contract architecture for the core policy management and claims execution systems
Technical specifications for oracle integration requirements across different parametric trigger types
Initial UI/UX mockups for the policy creation and management interfaces
Financial models for premium calculation across our initial target risk categories
We have not yet implemented a working prototype, which is why this grant funding is crucial for progressing to that stage. With funding support, we plan to develop a minimum viable product on Arbitrum testnet within 3-4 months, focusing first on a simple flood insurance parametric product as our proof of concept.

Do you know about any comparable protocol, event, game, tool or project within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The insurance vertical remains significantly underdeveloped on Arbitrum compared to other DeFi categories.

The closest adjacent projects include:

InsurAce - While they have deployed on Arbitrum, their focus is primarily on crypto-native insurance for smart contract failures, exchange hacks, and stable coin depeg events rather than parametric insurance for real-world risks. Their model relies on manual claims assessment rather than our fully automated parametric approach.

Neptune Mutual - They operate a coverage protocol for DeFi platforms against hacks and exploits on multiple chains including Arbitrum, but don't offer parametric insurance for natural disasters or cyber risks. Their coverage requires incident reporting and validation rather than using objective data triggers.

Risk Harbor - Recently deployed on Arbitrum, they offer protection for specific DeFi protocol risks but don't extend to parametric real-world coverage. Their focus remains within the crypto ecosystem rather than bridging to broader insurance needs.

This notable gap in the Arbitrum ecosystem creates a significant opportunity for Insuracle to establish a new category of financial services on the network. While insurance protocols exist on other chains (like Etherisc on Ethereum), their absence on Arbitrum means we can develop solutions specifically optimized for Arbitrum's technical capabilities and user base.

Our research indicates that parametric insurance represents one of the few remaining undeveloped financial primitives in the Arbitrum ecosystem, positioning Insuracle to become a category-defining protocol in this space.

What is the idea/project for which you are applying for a grant.

Insuracle is developing a decentralized parametric insurance protocol on Arbitrum that enables instant, automated payouts for real-world risks. Unlike traditional insurance that requires lengthy claims processing, our smart contracts automatically execute payments when predefined, verifiable conditions occur (e.g., flood water reaching specific levels or data breach indicators appearing on monitoring services).

We're implementing a three-layer architecture:

Core Policy Contracts: Manage policy creation, premium collection, and automated claims execution
Oracle Integration Framework: Connect to multiple data sources to verify trigger conditions with built-in redundancy
Risk Pool Management: Enable capital providers to fund specific risk categories with granular exposure control
We'll initially focus on two high-impact verticals where traditional insurance fails:

Natural disaster coverage (floods, drought) particularly for underserved regions
Cyber risk protection for small businesses priced out of conventional coverage
Our team combines actuarial expertise (Daniel Abraham, Bayes Business School) with cryptography and fintech experience (Kirill Slavin, Cambridge University, $100M fintech founder). This unique blend positions us to bridge traditional insurance principles with blockchain innovation.

Please explain how your idea/project aligns with the Arbitrum ecosystem goals.

Insuracle aligns perfectly with Arbitrum's ecosystem goals in several key dimensions:

DeFi Expansion: We extend Arbitrum's DeFi capabilities into an entirely new vertical—parametric insurance—creating a new financial primitive that complements existing lending, trading, and yield platforms. This diversifies Arbitrum's financial ecosystem beyond current offerings.

Real-World Utility: Our protocol bridges blockchain technology to tangible real-world utility by addressing universal needs for financial protection against disasters and risks. This advances Arbitrum's mission of bringing practical blockchain applications to mainstream users.

Ecosystem Integration: Insuracle is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Arbitrum protocols, enabling new composable use cases. For example, lending protocols could offer discount terms for borrowers with parametric insurance, creating synergistic ecosystem value.

User Acquisition: By addressing practical insurance needs, we'll attract new user segments to Arbitrum who are seeking financial protection rather than speculation—expanding the ecosystem's user base beyond crypto-natives.

Technical Excellence: Our implementation leverages Arbitrum's strengths in low transaction costs, high throughput, and security inheritance from Ethereum—all critical factors for a viable insurance protocol handling time-sensitive financial operations.

Sustainable Growth: Insurance represents a steady, sustainable source of TVL and transaction activity, contributing to Arbitrum's long-term growth with fundamentally different characteristics than volatile trading or lending markets.

Protocol Performance.

As Insuracle is currently at the idea stage, we do not have historical protocol performance metrics to report. We are starting with a clean slate, focusing on developing a robust parametric insurance solution from the ground up. Our KPIs will be established during development, with initial benchmarks focusing on smart contract efficiency, oracle response times, and policy execution reliability as outlined in our milestone deliverables.

Audit History & Security Vendors.

N/A

Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum.

Insuracle is designed with composability as a core principle, though implementation is pending development. Our parametric insurance protocol will enable multiple integration points with existing Arbitrum projects:

Coverage for DeFi protocols - allowing projects to offer users protection against specific platform risks

Insurance primitives as building blocks - enabling lending platforms to incorporate risk protection directly into their products

Premium pool liquidity - creating opportunities for yield aggregators to incorporate insurance premium strategies

Oracle data feeds - leveraging and extending existing oracle infrastructure for specialized insurance triggers

The modular design of our smart contracts will specifically enable these integrations through standardized interfaces, with implementation details to be finalized during development.

Is the proposal scope realistic and well-defined given the team, resources, and deliverables.

Yes, our proposal scope is realistic and carefully calibrated to our team's expertise and the requested resources. We've taken a pragmatic approach by:

Focusing on a single parametric insurance product (flood coverage) for our initial MVP rather than attempting multiple insurance types simultaneously

Limiting oracle integration to one or two data sources initially while building an extensible framework

Prioritizing core contract functionality over complex UI features for the first release

Setting a reasonable 5-month timeline that acknowledges the complexity of insurance-specific blockchain development

Our team combines the essential expertise required - actuarial science, smart contract development, and insurance industry experience. The deliverables are concrete and measurable, with clear technical specifications that will guide development. The budget allocation directly supports the critical path to a functional testnet MVP without including unnecessary scope expansion.
